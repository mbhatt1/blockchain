This is me following a tutorial on creating blockchains

I am going to skip testing for now. Will do the testing later

After building the basic DS, we build the API to talk to it using express framework

After the endpoints for registration have been added, now we need to sync the network

After that, consensus to figure out if a particular piece of data is correct. 

The one we will use is called longestt chain. Compare chain on chosen node to other chains in network. If one of the chains has a longer length, we replace the 
current chain to the longest chain. The longest chain is trustable because more work was done in that chain.
